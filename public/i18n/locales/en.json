      "items": {
        "q1": {
          "q": "Which countries do you have active programs in?",
          "a": "We currently have active programs in France, our flagship destination. We are in the process of launching formal programs for Spain, Portugal, and the United Arab Emirates. You can register your interest and we'll notify you as soon as they become available."
        },
        "q2": {
          "q": "What is the Passeport Talent and who is it for?",
          "a": "It is a multi-year residence permit (up to 4 years) exclusive to France, designed for high-potential profiles: researchers, artists, entrepreneurs, and investors. It allows you to work without an additional work permit and facilitates immediate family reunification."
        },
        "q3": {
          "q": "How long does the visa process take?",
          "a": "Times vary by destination and consulate. For France, the process typically takes between 2 and 6 weeks after the consular appointment. New Horizons speeds up this process by conducting a technical audit of your file before submission."
        },
        "q4": {
          "q": "Is it mandatory to speak the language of the destination country?",
          "a": "It depends on the program. In France, there is no initial language requirement for Investment and Passeport Talent visas; permanent residency after 5 years requires an A2/B1 level in French. Spain and Portugal also have gradual requirements. Our advisors will explain exactly what applies to your case."
        },
        "q5": {
          "q": "What should I do upon arriving at my destination with my visa?",
          "a": "In France, most VLS-TS visas must be validated with the OFII (French Office for Immigration and Integration) within the first 3 months. Each country has its own arrival steps; we accompany you and manage all these procedures on your behalf."
        },
        "q6": {
          "q": "What happens if my visa is rejected?",
          "a": "We have a legal team specialized in administrative appeals. In France, we operate before the CRRV (Commission for Appeals against Visa Refusal Decisions) in Nantes. Our 3-layer review system significantly reduces the risk of rejection before submission."
